# Condensation
Based on interThermalPhaseChangeFoam in OpenFOAM 2.4, we developed and investigated three condensation models (Lee model, Energy balance model, and Time recovery model).
A new energy balance model considering the ratio of gas-liquid thermal conductivity was developed, and its validation was conducted using the Stefan problem.
Research cases include stefan problem, Nusselt film condensation problem and bubble condensation problem.
